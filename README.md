This is the final examne project for norroff school.

I made a website in nextJS for my friend who sells fotball goals for clubs and private market.  The website is writen in nextJS for practical uses such as speed, SEO and other function that help an e-comerce website be recognized and visible. 

i ended up using snipCart as payment method and checkout, very easy to configure and easy to connect to payment methods such as stripe and other options. 

for the backend and API i used strapi-API, wich i prefer as the interface is very manageable and comes with a loot of powerfull tools to help you create a nice looking product page. the only major issue i ran in to was the image from strapi.

I had some issues with creating a post method for the admin webpage, but i managed to find a way in the end.
